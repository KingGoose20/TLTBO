Samuel McConaghy played great as a playmaker, setting up Alex with loads of opportunity, while also coming through with 2 points of his own. Rudy and Lukas both finished the day with 1 point. There were no other point scorers on the day"],
    "DefensiveDescription": ["Samuel McConaghy is back like he never left, with some trademark unbreachable defence, lightning quick hands to get steals, and insane hops to contest shots. Alex joined Samuel to create a wall of 5 Musketeers, and I come in at third with 3 blocks in one game. Angus proves again that he is him, spending all of lunch having to deal with the best players on the opposing teams. Nicholas rounds of the list at 5, with impressive all-round interior and perimeter defence."]

Rudy Hoschke played a similar game, also coming in with 2 points. Angus, as usual, created some high-quality scoring chances, with tough moves to get him and others open to score. Michael and Mitch both came in with 1 point, however Mitch shot 1 from 1, and was safe with the ball, which set him above Michael."],
    "DefensiveDescription": ["Alex Galt was like a wall in the paint, his interior defence coming clutch to give the short-handed 5 musketeers the win today. Angus just did Angus things, making feats such as guarding Rudy and Alex look like child’s play. Rudy was much the same, coming in with a strong interior and perimeter game. Nicholas was also pivotal in the 5 musketeers win, and Will Kim played strongly, as well as stunning the crowd with a strong block on Alex."]

Samuel comes in a 2nd with equal second most points (3) however what set him apart was his lack of turnovers, and all-round efficient offence. I come in at 3rd with three points, including a mid-range and a 3. My turnovers on the day held me below Sam. Michael is in at 4 with two tough middies, one coming in the clutch in the final game, and one coming to earn the Wet Willies their first dub. Ryan with two points, and tough bank middie and a nice layup of the post moves."],
    "DefensiveDescription": ["While Kimmy didn’t record a point, his defence guided the Loose Gooses to the dub, holding Alex to only one point against the Loose Gooses. Samuel McConaghy did all he could, guarding Michael and Angus to get his team the win, with his trademark lockdown D. Angus comes in just behind Samuel, with a very strong day, however a couple of late makes from Rudy and Samuel push him to third. Alex Galt remained a brick wall in the paint, coming in at 4, and Nicholas did a good job of supporting his teammates with help defence, while being a physical presence in rebounding and post defence."]

William Kim proved the haters wrongs, pulling up today looking like vintage Kimmy, hitting his unguardable fade 3 times to guide the short handed Loose Gooses to a strong second place. Samuel McConaghy had a great day acting in his natural position as playmaker, feeding Alex all day, while also recording two points. Nicholas in at 4 with 2 finishes, one of those being really tough off the drive, and Rudy in due to his all round play, and two point effort. "],
    "DefensiveDescription": ["In a dominant performance by the 5 Musketeers, 3 players made each list as the took advantage of a weaker playing field. Samuel McConaghy is a defensive force, ever present in the paint and on the perimeter. Alex Galt held the paint in his grasp, allowing no one to breach, and no one to score. Will Kim rose up spectacularly for his usual blocks and shot contests, playing a large part in the Loose Gooses placing. Rudy Hoschke, despite his team’s poor result, was doing all he could on the defensive end. In at 5, the third player from the 5 Musketeers big three, Nicholas Szogi, using his size to box out and prevent."]

Michael had his second straight day with 4 points, going from a lack of confidence in the first few weeks to scoring tough shots 24/7. Samuel comes in at three, also with 4 points on a day without 2 of his best players. Kimmy comes in at 4, with some vintage Kimmy makes, and Chris rounds out the top 5, with a nice middie and a finish. Honourable mention to Jasper, I just thought that Chris' shots were a bit tougher. "],
    "DefensiveDescription": ["The top 4 remains the same for offence and defence. Rudy and Michael both pulled up on both ends to create one of the most dominant performances in LTBO history. Samuel comes in at third, pulling his team up to 2nd place almost singlehandedly, (Jasper and Ryan you played well). Kimmy is in 4th, doing a good of a job as he could to contest shots, pick up rebounds and hold down the paint without Angus. I come in a 5, with a couple of blocks and defensive stops. "]

Rudy places at second, after another impressive point scoring performance, with 6 points, as well as some offensive rebounds. I come in at 3rd with 4 points, including one three and multiple assists. Michael gets his 3rd offensive selection in as many days, with another impressive showing, with three tough mid-ranges. Mitch Yue gets his first offensive all team, with some playmaking passes, and doubling his points total all term. (2 today)"],

Samuel comes in at second, doing a great job in stopping teams scoring for as much as 5 minutes, playing for a very weakened 5M. Rudy comes in at three, his typical impressive day at both ends shining through, with blocks, and some lockdown interior D in multiple situations.Christopher was elite with the double teams today, switching from Sam, to Rudy, to Michael and coming up with multiple defensive stops.

Angus is in at 3 on his first day back, his effect obvious as the LG were struggling today without him on defense. Kimmy comes in at 4, with a good effort to guard the other teams bigs.

Sam tops the list with 5 points, and despite having the third most points, Alex comes in at second in his return, playing a major part in the 5M's reclaiming their throne. Rudy comes in at 3rd with 5 points, and his teammate and GM Michael is in at 4 with as many points (all threes?!?!) Rounding out the offensive list is Angus, coming in with 2 points in his second game back from injury."],

Michael is in at three, with his teammate Rudy in at four, another tandem of two players being strong alongside each other on the defensive end.

The LG's big man and primary rebounder in Chris finds himself at 2 after a great scoring day, he comes in with 3 points.

Again I apologise, the 5 Musketeers yesterday had an even better day, however today the LG's only losing two games means that their players make up the list. First in the defensive list is the GM Angus, a great day guarding the other teams 1 options, and his term 1 retained player and second option Kimmy comes in a two.
