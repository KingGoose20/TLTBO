    "OffensiveDescription":["In a day of few scores (wind â˜¹) Alexander Galt and Angus Walker both finished on the same number of points on the day (3) however as the 5 Musketeers finished 1st Alexander takes the top spot. Samuel McConaghy played great as a playmaker, setting up Alex with loads of opportunity, while also coming through with 2 points of his own. Rudy and Lukas both finished the day with 1 point. There were no other point scorers on the day"],
    "DefensiveDescription":["Samuel McConaghy is back like he never left, with some trademark unbreachable defence, lightning quick hands to get steals, and insane hops to contest shots. Alex joined Samuel to create a wall of 5 Musketeers, and I come in at third with 3 blocks in one game. Angus proves again that he is him, spending all of lunch having to deal with the best players on the opposing teams. Nick rounds of the list at 5, with impressive all-round interior and perimeter defence."]
