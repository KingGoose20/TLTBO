                    <p style="text-align: left;">The Finals are made up of two parts, 'Finals Week', and 'The Grand
                        Finale'. Finals Week runs during what would be the 6th week of the season, and has different
                        rules to the main part of the tournament (see below). The Grand Finale is one massive,
                        action-packed day to conclude the season and decide who is the championship team.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">How are these Finals different to
                        last season?</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">While a lot of the rules are the same, there are some major changes,
                        being: <br><br>
                        - Any team has the ability to win the championship. <u style="color: grey">Unlike last season,
                            where the top team would
                            win if they were ahead by enough points, it is now possible for even the third-place team to
                            win, if they perform well enough during The Grand Finale.</u>
                        <br><br>
                        - Finals Week is broken into three seperate days, with a different points system. <u
                            style="color: grey">Last season, Finals Week was broken into two two-day parts, each worth
                            up to 4 points. This term, every day is back to its own, but the ladder points system has
                            changed. Instead of the team with the highest win percentage getting a set amount of points,
                            for every <b>two</b> wins each team gets, they receive one ladder point.</u>

                            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                                <li>Each game is a best-of-3
                                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                                        <li>While pretty self-explanatory, each game will be first to two points. Every
                                            type of
                                            point is counted as one, except three pointers, which are counted as two.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>If there is an 'and-one', players have the option to shoot the free throw
                                            for the
                                            extra point to win the game. However, if they miss, the other team regains
                                            possession.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>For every two games that a team wins, they will recieve one ladder point.
                                            This
                                            means, theoretically, a team could recieve no points on a given day, or even
                                            5.</li>
                                        <li>Based on current scoring averages, this means each team would win a similar
                                            number
                                            of points to the usual, but it makes 'good' or 'bad' days more important.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Extra explanation: This rule is to highlight the importance of playing well
                                            throughout the whole week, just like you have to play well throughout all of
                                            the
                                            playoffs. Having just one day of bad games can affect your ladder placing a
                                            lot, as
                                            it is possible to get no points. On the other hand, having a dominant
                                            performance
                                            can push you well ahead of the other teams.</li>

                                <li>Like how last term's Grand Finale was broken into sections, this Grand Finale is as
                                    well. The three sections are as so:</li>
                                <li>2x 30 Minute Sections, which are played the normal TLTBO way</li>
                                <li>The Decider Games (more on those below)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Each team will will be allowed one timeout AND video replay throughout the first two part of
                            the day
                            <ul>
                                <li>Each team will also have one of each during each placing game.</li>
                                <li>To call a timeout, the team GM must yell it loudly, and hold a 'T' symbol in the
                                    air. Their team MUST be in possession
                                    of the ball, meaning that they must be either
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>holding the ball</li>
                                        <li>or dribbling the ball in a controlled manner</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    However, a team can call a timeout at any stop of play.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>To request a video replay, the team GM must yell it loudly during the game. If there
                                    is not a valid reason to call a replay, they lose their replay and possession of the
                                    ball. If the replay is successful, they regain their replay. If a decision cannot be
                                    made, the team that had the ball if the replay was never called gains possession,
                                    and they regain their replay.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>After the first two parts of the day, the 'Decider Games' begin. There are two decider
                            games, the 'Play-In', and the 'Championship Game'. Rules for the games are as so:
                            <ul>
                                <li>BOTH games are a first-to-7</li>
                                <li>The 'Play-In' game will be 2nd vs 3rd, with 2nd starting with the ball AND up 1-0.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The advantage of being up 1-0 is to give 2nd a better advantage for placing
                                            higher during the season. If they just started with the ball, 2nd would be
                                            nearly not rewarded at all.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>The 'Championship Game' will be the winner of the 'Play-In' against 1st place. 1st
                                    place will start with the ball.

                                        <li>A lot of people have wondered why 1st doesn't start up 1-0. It has been
                                            decided that their automatic placing in the Championship Game is enough of
                                            an advantage over their opposition.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Between each game will be a 5-minute break, allowing each team to rest and regather
                                    themselves before their next challenge.</li>
                                <li>Before the Championship Game, there will be player introductions. We will start with
                                    the winner of the 'Play-In', then the 1st place team.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Team ties:
                            <ul>
                                <li>As the 5 Musketeers and the Loose Gooses are tied heading into Finals Week, we may
                                    have to go into tie breakers. If the teams tie on the Grand Finale, the following
                                    strucutre will be followed:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Better head-head record on the day</li>
                                        <li>Higher win-streak on the day</li>
                                        <li>Higher for/against ratio on the day</li>
                                        <li>Best of 5 to determine the winner, with the team winning a game most
                                            recently starting</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Timeouts / Video replays
                            <ul>
                                <li>It is against the rules to call a 'fake' timeout or video replay. There is no need
                                    to yell the words 'Timeout' or 'Replay', or any words similar, unless you are trying
                                    to actually call it. If you call a 'fake' timeout/replay, your team will be
                                    penalised by losing their timeout/videoreplay, and the ball.</li>
                                <li>Calling a timeout or videoreplay when you do not have one. If you call for one while
                                    you do not have one, you will be penalised of the ball. Every time (after the first
                                    time) this happens, the opposing team will shoot a free throw and regain the ball.
                                </li>
                                <li>Timeouts will last for 1 minute.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Unsportsmanlike Conduct
                            <ul>
                                <li>Any actions seemed unsportsmanlike, such as an intentional push, slap, hit, etc.,
                                    will result in the opposing team gaining possession of the ball and one free throw.
                                    For every extra act of unsportsmanlike conduct by a team, the opposing team will
                                    shoot an extra free throw.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Media Session

                                <li>Now that we have high quality cameras, as well as an Instragram, and more 'official'
                                    posts, it has been decided that we will have a quick media session for each player.
                                    This is completly optional, but is recommended. It will take around 3 minutes per
                                    person, as all we are doing is taking 5 different photos:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Player Photo: The official photo of you, to be used under the 'Stats' page instead of your school photo.</li>
                                        <li>Action Photos: Three action photos of you, doing any moves of your choice (could be a jumpshot, a layup, dribbling) </li>
                                        <li>A 'hype' Photo: A photo of you being hyped or excited, to be used if you win an award or the championship 😉</li>
