          <p>Hey everyone, it’s Angus Walker, GM of the Loose Gooses, here with the first ever ‘crunching numbers’! While I could go into heapsssss of details behind why teams are/were performing they way they are, 
            I know you guys probably can’t be bothered to read all of that. So, I’ve broken down some interesting patterns in wins, and made some dot points for some extra information down the bottom. Hope you enjoy!
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 >The Wet Willies: Super team or Lucky Start?</h3>
            <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p>While it may be too early to say now, the story of the Wet Willies has been simple; a domination in the first week, winning 69.2% of their games, before dropping off, winning just 44.4% in the second week, 
                and not winning a single game on the Monday of week 3. So, what changed? As a start, leaders Rudy Hoschke and Alexander Galt have had a huge drop in average points, from 2.75 each to just 1 and 2.3, respectively. 
                This adds to a total decrease of nearly 2.2 points between the two, which, by looking at the averages, moves their wins from a ‘1st place’ category, to a ‘2nd place’ category. <em>(The average wins of a team that comes 
                first is 7.25, compared to 4.95 for second place)</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>But we obviously can’t just blame the leaders for not performing to standard. After all, they don’t just magically perform worse, there’s always a reason. While stats don’t tell the story, it is safe to assume that the other 
                teams have finally figured out how to defend the two leaders, especially Alex’s size. Both teams have started to defend Alex’s interior ability better, as well as stopping offensive rebounds. <br><br>
                The Loose Gooses acquiring William Kim has made a huge impact for them, as he has the ability to defend Alex, putting less pressure on the GM to stop both Alex and Rudy. Furthermore, William Kim’s offensive talents have 
                eased the load on Angus Walker, making the defence on him weaker, which has allowed him to increase his PPG from 1.25 to 2.33. <br><br>
                For the 5 Musketeers, adding Michael Iffland proved to be worthwhile, as his playmaking and ability to read the game has allowed for more offensive talent, and, just like with the Loose Gooses, has allowed Samuel McConaghy 
                to increase his PPG by nearly 1. The GM has also seemed to take command of his team more, orchestrating their defence better, allowing them to stop the power house of Alex and Rudy. <br><br>
                
                While there are little facts to back these statements up, it is safe to say that the trade involving William Kim and Michael Iffland had a huge impact for the league. All three teams are looking more balanced, with a 3-way tie even occurring.

            <h3>Interesting Points</h3>
            <br>
            <ul >
                <li>Between Week 1 and the time of writing, the average wins by 3rd and 2nd place has increased by 0.7, with 1st place decreasing by 1.4, meaning the league has become more balanced</li><br>
                <li>After finishing the first week with a win% of 30, the Loose Gooses has had a win% of 55 since.</li><br>
                <li>The 5 Musketeers have had the smallest changes out of all teams, increasing their win% from 48 to 55.</li><br>
                <li>Typically, if a team wins more than 3 games in a row, they will win the day.</li><br>
                <li>Rudy Hoschke and Lukas Johnston are the ‘microwaves’ of the league, with scoring streaks of 2-3 points not rare for them.</li><br>
                <li>Angus Walker and Samuel McConaghy are the ‘slow starters’ of the league, increasing their PPG by roughly 1 since the first week.</li><br>
                <li>The William Kim/Michael Iffland trade is the ‘turning point’ of the league, increasing their respective teams win percentages by 17% and 10%, decreasing the Wet Willies by 15%</li>
            </ul>
