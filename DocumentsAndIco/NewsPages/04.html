          <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Iâ€™ll start off by saying that I honestly didnâ€™t think the WW would go from being
            so dominant (term 1), to so completely God awful (term 2), I mean, think about it. This team had what is
            considered the best possible team someone could have in this tournament, and now theyâ€™re bums. The fact that
            they had the ability to keep two of those players as well (1 remains the GM and then retains someone else)
            means that realistically thereâ€™s no way the shouldâ€™ve become this bad. I think itâ€™s a mix of poor drafting,
            poor choice in player retaining, and a grass is always greener mentality. </p>
          <br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">Drafting</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A perfect example for how to draft the best possible team is the term 2 Loose
            Gooses. Angus ignored the big names and chose for which players had the best attributes to suit his team.
            The WW decision to give themselves the 1st pick (meaning their next pick was 6th overall) which put a great
            strain on their depth, and even greater strain if their 1 pick didnâ€™t fit in. It seemed Lukas was the
            obvious choice at 1 seed. The mock draft had the top three being Lukas, Nick and Clarrie, and Lukas had
            unarguably the better term 1 out of those three. However, one could argue that the unmatchable chemistry
            created by Sam, Lukas and Michael played a part in this. Samâ€™s ability to move the ball quickly gave Lukas
            his scoring chances. However, in a team where there already was a primary scorer (Rudy) and only one solid
            ball mover, Lukas was destined not to fit in. Only 4 days have been played, but it seems that this destiny
            is becoming reality. </p>
          <br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">Player Retention:</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rudy. Heâ€™s crazy at basketball. Iâ€™m not saying anything else. But Iâ€™m going to
            run a little mock simulation here. He doesnâ€™t wanna be GM, right? So, appoint Alex GM. Alex retains Rudy.
            They take the 2nd and 5th picks in the draft. Draft Michael second (after Lukas), and Ryan fifth (after
            Clarrie). After Ryan, the logical draft order would be Chris 6th, Connor 7th. So, 8th would logically be
            Jasper. If the WW want Will though, they take Will. All of a sudden, their line-up goes from 1 big, 2
            primary scorers clashing, and a lack of shooting, to a team with the 2 biggest players, who were the reason
            why the WW were so good in Term 1. Michael is the only shooter you need when you have Alex and Rudy in the
            paint. Now youâ€™ve got everything you need to have a run at the chip. Two bigs, great in the paint at both
            ends. A primary playmaker to feed them, whoâ€™s also a capable scorer when needed. Perimeter defence in
            Michael and Ryan. And someone there to guard the other teamâ€™s 5th man, and score on them, as we know he can,
            Willie. Much better than their current shitshow.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">Grass is Always Greener Mentality:</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Term 1 WW were truly unstoppable. And they had a pretty good chance going into
            Term 2 to mimic that team and create something close to it. But Rudy got it in his head that he could
            recreate the term 1 team, with new players. Itâ€™s pretty obvious that he did not. Oh well. ðŸ¤·</p>
          <br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">Term 2 WW Compared to Term 1 LG:</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(The term 1 LG will be their final roster, not the one they drafted)
            I think the WW are better. You basically need to look no further then 2 things. Size, and Big three. The
            term 1 LG had two great players, but while the other teams had high drafted, good players, the LGâ€™s big
            three final member was originally a free agent. Additionally, this terms WW have a better â€˜big nameâ€™ team,
            and more size. Term 2 WW in 7.

          <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">Note from CEO</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Goddamn. Wet Willies, if this isn't a wakeup call I don't know what can get y'all
            going.<br>
            You have an ex-WW talking crazy smack and calling you guys a 'shit show'. With just 9 (up to 12 if lucky)
            days remaining, it's time to step up.<br>
            Michael, you're the GM of the team, it's time for you to figure this team out. You have an ex-GM, the runner
            up in MVP voting, yourself, and two solid defenders.<br><br>
            Show the league what y'all got.</p>
