                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;">Well, what a preseason there has
                        been with some very amazing plays, but let’s take a look into the
                        teams; The Wet Willes and their big three are just warming up, the Loose Gooses and their
                        rocky start to preseason are looking to get back on track, and the 5 Musketeers and
                        how the big two of Sam and Alex dominate the games with the unstoppable force. First, let's dive
                        deeper into the CEO minds of what preseason is.
                        Preseason is a very special period of preparation before the upcoming regular season. It is a
                        time when teams get back in shape, develop strategies and work on their game plans. It helps
                        players get into shape and prepare for the upcoming regular season (Lukas).<br><br>
                        Preseason games are important because they provide everyone with the opportunity to experiment
                        with different line-ups and tactics, while also evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of their
                        players. This is especially true for new players or rookies, who are trying to impress coaches
                        and earn a spot on the team's roster.<br><br>
                        Overall, preseason in sports is an important time for teams and players to prepare for the
                        upcoming regular season, and it provides fans with a glimpse of what's to come. While the
                        results of preseason games do not count towards the regular season standings, they are still
                        valuable opportunities for teams and players to improve and get ready for the challenges
                        ahead.<br><br>

                        Well at the conclusion of the preseason it is clear that there is a favourite team to win,
                        throughout the week they have shown their clear dominance in their two-man game, being
                        unstoppable from mid-range and finishing, while also dominating on the boards. Alex draws
                        the defenders in which leads to plenty of space for Samuel McConaghy to shoot the ball
                        effectively. While it is also to see sitting on the side lines, they have a strong two-man game
                        but doesn’t really pass to their teammates.<br><br>
                        While also the sharp shooting of another team has been shown through the final couple of days of
                        the preseason. With the first 3’s made and then to follow it up quickly by another one the GM
                        selected these players who space the floor and effectively shoot the ball this leaves a lot of
                        space for their star finishing Angus Walker. While Will Kim also spreads the floor, he is one of
                        the defensive strong holds for this team with his awe inspiring blocks.<br><br>
                        And Finally, onto the last team the Wet Willes they have the “Big three” while it takes a while
                        for the Michael and Lukas to warm up from their holidays they are going to need to step up to
                        lead their team scoring less than 2 in total over the week. While this team doesn’t look the
                        best on paper they come through in the game with the flashy passes of Michael Iffland while also
                        the acrobatic leaping of Lukas Johnston so hopefully they step up before the start of the
                        regular season.
