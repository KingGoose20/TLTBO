                    <p>Hey everyone, it's your favourite CEO Angus Walker and today I'm going to break down the various
                        changes that have happened to the website. Over this term I’ve been making lots of changes to
                        the website, to make it as cool and epic for you guys as it can be, so I thought I should share
                        the best ones with you.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered">1. Team animations on ladder page</h2>
                    <p>Most of you have probably noticed by now, but whenever you hover over a team’s image on the
                        ladder page, a funky animation will play, and will show the players on that team. After a few
                        seconds the animation will go away, and you will be able to check out the other teams. Click <a
                            href="../Ladder.html">HERE</a> to check it out!</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered">2. Results growing animation</h2>
                    <p>Once again, you’ve probably noticed this by now, but whenever you hover over a players name under
                        ‘box score’ on the <a href="../Results.html">results page</a>, their name will grow to make
                        their results easier to see. Additionally, the ‘game by game’ section will rotate through
                        emphasising each game, so that everyone’s bucket and win gets shown off.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered">3. Team Records from the day</h2>
                    <p>A smaller, but helpful change that I’ve added, is seeing each teams record from the most recent
                        day played. On the results page, underneath where it says which team will start with the ball,
                        every teams record (recorded as wins-losses), their win percentage from the day, and the number
                        of points their team will receive are listed. Looking at this section is a good way to quickly
                        see how each team performed from the day.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered">4. Random images on news pages</h2>
                    <p>As you can see on this page, every time you load a news page a different NBA picture (8 in total)
                        is shown. This small feature helps to make each page look more unique, and it’s always cool to
                        see more action pictures.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered">5. See stats on results and ladder click</h2>
                    <p>Finally, the last change that I’ll go into detail about is that on the ‘results’ and ‘ladder’
                        pages, whenever you see a players name, or their stats, you can click on it to automatically
                        take you to their stats page. This can be helpful for when you see someone got a few buckets in
                        a day, and you want to see how they’ve been playing over the season.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br><br>
                    <p>While these are probably the most helpful features, there are about some more that I've added
                        that I won't go into detail about. Below is a list so that you can check any of them out if
                        you'd like.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>News Articles grow when hovered on</li>
                        <li>Results and Stats lists' have alternating background colour</li>
                        <li>Headings have colour animations</li>
                        <li>Heading links grow when hovered on</li>
                        <li>Calendar page has dates when hovering on</li>
                        <li>Everyone's Stats picture has team-coloured border</li>
                        <li>The third Sam (super cool edition) - can you find him?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <p>Finally, I want to thank you all for using my website lots. We are already at 1700 total views,
                        which is one-third of how many we got last term - pretty good seeing we've only played 4 days
                        this season. If you ever have any feedback or ideas for the website, email me because I always
                        want to make the website bigger and better.</p>
