          <p><strong>Week 1</strong> kicks off with an incredibly doiminant performance from the Wet Willies, winning 9 of their 12 games. They 5 Musketeers go 50/50, and the Loose Gooses get only one win.
        The Wet Willies continue their dominant performances throughout the week, winning 70% of their games, coming first every single day. The Loose Gooses come second just once, winning an all-time low of 29% of games.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Week 2</strong> starts with the 5 Musketeers getting their first win of the tournament, with the Loose Gooses and Wet Willies tying. Lukas continues to lead his team in scoring, and Kimmy starts to find his 
            rhythm with the Loose Gooses. The Loose Gooses get their first win, and sign rising star Chris Tomkinson as a way to fix their commitment issues. The Wet Willies drop off, winning just 45% of games this week.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Week 3</strong> starts with an upset by the Loose Gooses, winning 5 straight and getting yet another win. The 5 Musketeers keep sitting in second, not really moving closer to first or third. The Wet Willies'
            hot start has certainly slowed down, with them winning just 5 games throughout the first day. Lukas starts to cool down, with his GM Samuel McConaghy starting to get it going. However, the Wet Willies go on a rampage to
            finish the week, with an extremly similar day to the first day of the tournament. Alex and Rudy each drop 4 points in the blow out.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Week 4</strong> is the shortest week of the season, with only 2 days being played due to various factors (including some veggie tennis). The Loose Gooses win both days, with Chris Tomkinson leading the way for a win.
            As usual, the 5 Musketeers keep coming second, and even dethrone the Wet Willies for a day before sinking down to second again. The rule book is finalised along with the trade deadline, and tensions start to rise as teams are desperate
            to win.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Week 5</strong> is the most hectic week of them all, with every team changing place at least once. The Loose Gooses finally escape third place, and the 5 Musketeers say goodbye to first place and say hello to third. The briefly 
            dethroned Wet Willies regain first, but the Loose Gooses continue to catch up to them. Angus Walker drops a league-high 5 points, with Rudy Hoschke doing the same the next day to show why their team's first. But disaster stirkes the Wet Willies;
            their prized leader goes down with an ankle injury, leaving their team to finish the season off by themselves. The now short-handed Wet Willies instantly come third, with the 5 Musketeers who only had <i>3</i> players manage to beat them from a dominant 
            performance by bucket-getter Lukas Johnston. With the last day of the season approaching, the Loose Gooses, now 0.5 points away from first, look to overcome their slow start and assert themselves as the best team in the league heading into finals. And <strong>OH MY GOODNESS
            WILLIAM KIM </strong>- KIMMY DROPS <strong>SIX</strong> moster buckets to finish off the season! The Loose Gooses soar past the other teams, winning a whopping 77% of games. They overtake the Wet Willies to get into first place, a fantastic way for them to finish
            the regular season.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>With the regular season over, the next few days determine the fate of every team. While the 5 Musketeers are currently third place, if they win both games before the final they'll be in first. And no matter the lead, any team can be defeated if things go the right way. Rest up everyone,
          we've got finals coming.
