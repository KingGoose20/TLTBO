          <p>Hey everyone, it’s me, Angus Walker, GM of the Loose Gooses and CEO of the LTBO, here with the second
            ‘Crunching Numbers’! This article is looking into the finals, how each team performed, and what each team
            needs to do to
            give themselves the best chance at winning the chip. I'm going to try to make this one a little shorter, so
            get reading!
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Finals Week: The Story of Each Team</h3>
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p>The first two rounds of the finals just finished, meaning that we’re left with just one more monster day
              – the Grand Finale. While the date is still being decided, the 90 minute session is going to be packed
              with highlights, tough buckets,
              and defensive efforts. I already know the tensions and beef between teams are going to be CRAZY high,
              already this week it’s been wild. The finals have been incredibly exciting, at least for two of the teams.
              The <strong>5 Musketeers</strong> and <strong>Wet Willies</strong>
              traded wins, having near identical records (the 5 Musketeers had one more win and one less loss over the
              four days). The <strong>Loose Gooses</strong> however were no where to be seen, getting just four wins
              over the two days. Anyways, here’s the breakdown for each team:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><span class="section-heading centered">Wet Willies:</span><br> Over the course of the tournament, it’s
              been hard to find any faults with
              the Wet Willies. They’ve dominated for the majority of the tournament, and if it wasn’t for a sloppy week
              or two, they’d be way ahead of the competition. With <strong>GM Rudy Hoschke</strong> returning after
              injury, the Wet Willies have been at full power, winning 60% of their games. They came away with second
              and first, placing at first place on the ladder, 3 points ahead of second. While you could put the success
              to <strong>Alexander Galt</strong> and Rudy Hoschke, their scoring has come from different players
              entirely. While Alex and Rudy have combined for an extra 2.8 points per game during the finals,
              <strong>Nicholas
                Szogi</strong> (who has the highest increase during the finals at 4.9 ppg) and <strong>Clarrie
                Jones</strong> have been the leading scorers, combining for an extra <em>8.8</em> points per game.
              They’ve combined for
              60% of their teams points, making a huge impact as third and fourth man. Clarrie has hit a whopping 4
              threes, and Nick has 3. With each game being a best-of-3, the three point shot makes a huge difference, as
              it means an automatic win. While they’ve been doing the scoring, the
              success has been a huge team effort, each player contributing in their own ways. <strong>Ryan
                Pattemore</strong> has continued his lock down defence (after winning the perimeter defender award), and
              <strong>Willie Weekes</strong> (winner of the teammate award) always has his teams back, cheering them up
              after a loss
              or celebrating with them after a win, as well as getting some steals and rebounds. <br><br>The team has led the
              way all season long, and have backed up their trash talk with their success. Two players on the Wet
              Willies take my ‘x-factor’ of the Grand Finale - Clarrie Jones and Alexander Galt. If they can both be on
              the top of their game, it’ll be hard to stop a team that has two dominant forwards, and a guard that can
              shoot. However, if they're below average, I believe the team might struggle. But if they play to their
              best, it’ll take some seriously tough defence to take them down.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><span class="section-heading centered">5 Musketeers: </span><br>The 5 Musketeers are known for being
              right in the middle. They’ve been in
              second place nearly the entire tournament, with just two days in first, and two in third. They’re well
              known for their team chemistry and shot creation, with it seeming like they can get an open shot for
              anyone. While their
              GM might not lead them in scoring, <strong>Samuel McConaghy</strong> has shown he knows the game, often
              making great reads off screens and creating good looks for <strong>Lukas Johnston</strong> (the team
              scoring leader), and <strong>Michael Iffland</strong>. But they don’t just have one playmaker. Michael
              Iffland, who won the
              playmaking (and third man) award, never fails to amaze everyone with his flashy passes. And they’re not
              just for looks; while the stats don’t track it, there’s little doubt that Michael would have an assist on
              half of their teams scores. <br><br> The 5 Musketeers aren’t built around one person like so many good
              teams are, their
              entire team contributes to their wins – the main reason behind their consistency. Talking about
              consistency, the team ALWAYS has all 5 players, with the only exceptions being if someone’s sick or
              injured. By having all five players day in and day out, their chemistry has gone through the roof, and
              their playing style shows it. While
              they’re not the stars on their team, <strong>Conor Farrington</strong> and <strong>Jasper Collier</strong>
              play a solid role in the 5 Musketeers success. Conor and Jasper have averaged 1.5 points per game during
              the finals, and both have scored a point to win the game. Both players can play quality defence, and know
              how to space the
              floor to give the teams scorers (especially Lukas) room for an open shot. With the way they move the ball
              and work together, each break isn’t reliant on a special someone to perform well, which may be the upper
              hand to winning the tournament. With each player on the team constantly seeing improvement in their
              offensive talents, they could have a powerhouse of finishing and shooting come Friday. And if everything
              clicks, they might be unguardable.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><span class="section-heading centered">Loose Gooses: </span><br>Ahh, my own team, the Loose Gooses. I’m
              going to do my best to take this
              report with an unbiased view, and see us as anyone else would see us. The Loose Gooses have been known for
              one thing this season – commitment. As everyone knows, its rare to see the LG’s with more than 4 players,
              with there being multiple days of only having two. Despite this, the underdogs have fought through every
              day, and despite being down 7 points after Week 1, saw first place for half a week before slipping into
              second, and now back into third. While it may seem like they haven’t made any progress all season, the
              team cut the difference from 7 points to 3.5, even though they didn't have more than 3 players all of
              Finals
              Week. I think it’s fair to say that the team could be the best in the league if it wasn’t for such issues,
              as the two weeks leading up to the finals (where they often had 4-5 players), they won 4 of the 6 days.
              <br>
              <br>
              The team has a wide range of talent, from their GM <strong>Angus Walker</strong>, who averages 2.2 points
              per game,
              averaging 5.5 in the finals, to the deadly mid-range and post scorer <strong>William Kim</strong>, who
              averages 1.8 PPG, as
              well as having the most improved player <strong>Chris Tomkinson</strong> who is good with quick cuts and
              defensive efforts.
              Furthermore, the team has two solid back up guards, being <strong>Mitch Yue</strong>, known for his
              agility and stealing
              the ball off anyone, and <strong>Shaun Alexiou</strong>, known for his confidence and ability to get an
              open shot for
              himself.
              <br>
              With everyone on the team knowing the date of the Grand Finale, the Loose Gooses have got a great chance
              of having a full team, something the others aren’t used to. As the GM said himself <em><u>‘They’re used to
                  only
                  dealing with three of us. Once we have 5, they won’t have know what to do.’</u></em> While we haven’t
              seen much of
              the full squad, the stats don’t lie. The Loose Gooses are a winning team when they’ve got everyone. But,
              you can say the same about every other team. Each team has had their share of being under numbered, so the
              Loose Gooses aren’t fully alone. Only time will tell.

                  id="countDown"></span></strong> away, I hope that this article
              has given you some insight into what your team needs to change, or to keep the same, to give yourselves
              the best chance at winning the tournament. These last second changes might very well be the key to
              claiming the LTB Championship. Best of luck, and I'll see you all on Friday.</p>
