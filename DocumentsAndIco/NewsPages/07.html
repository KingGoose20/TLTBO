                    <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Welcome back to Crunching Numbers, the first article from this season!
                        In this article, I’m going to break down some interesting stats throughout the league. I’ve
                        broken down three stats into detail, and at the bottom of this page will be a list of some other
                        statistics. Use this information as you will, statistic analysis can be the difference between a
                        winning and losing team. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">1. The 5 Musketeers are the only team
                        that has a declining win %</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">As the heading says, the 5 Musketeers are the only team in the league
                        that is trending in a losing direction. After starting their first 4 days winning 65% of games,
                        they have broken 50% just once, and have been at just 31% since. Their most recent day they were
                        1-10, a crushing 9%. While this is most likely due to being incredibly undermanned, and missing
                        their center piece Alexander Galt, these recent struggles are certainly a worry for the
                        Musketeers, as they’ve seen their 5 point lead on second dwindle to a 4 point lead on third
                        place. With Galt returning throughout this week, will he help bring the 5 Musketeers over their
                        slump, back to winning basketball?
                        On the other hand, the Wet Willies have had the biggest spike in performance, increasing from
                        37% over the first four days to 66% since then. They are now sitting at 56%, the only team above
                        50. Despite this, the WW still sit in third, but they can’t be overlooked; they’re creeping up
                        on not just second, but first place.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">2. Total games played increase</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Another big change from last season is that the average number of games
                        played each day has increased from 15 to 20 (a 33% increase). This change not just shows that
                        we’re getting more action, but the talent in the league has improved. Remember, each playing
                        session is the same length, so the only reason for these changes is that the scoring ability has
                        improved. Big congratulations to the league for such a massive improvement.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">3. Lopsided dominance
                    </h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">After some detailed analysis, I’ve found some interesting trends in the
                        data. Certain players seem to play better against certain teams, and significantly worse against
                        others. Alexander Galt of the 5 Musketeers scores 2 of his 2.6 ppg against the Loose Gooses, or
                        ~80% of his total points. On the other hand, Samuel McConaghy scores just 25% of his points
                        against the Loose Gooses, or just 0.6 of his 2.4 average. On the other hand, Angus Walker scores
                        64% of his points against the Wet Willies, and Clarrie Jones scores 67% against the 5
                        Musketeers. Michael Iffland and Ryan Pattemore are split right down the middle, scoring 50% of
                        their points against each team.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading centered" style="text-align: left;">Other Stats List</h2>
                    <ol style="text-align: left; line-height: 30px; font-size: 17px">
                        <li>Conor Farrington is now on a 4 day points streak!</li>
                        <li>Yesterday was the first day that Angus Walker didn’t record a single point. :(</li>
                        <li>First place typically wins 50% of games, followed by 30% for second and 20% for third,
                            nearly identical to last season.</li>
                        <li>Lukas Johnston has had the biggest decrease in performance, down 5.84%</li>
                        <li>Michael Iffland has had the biggest increase in performance, up 4.85%</li>
                        <li>Samuel McConaghy has the highest midrange : points ratio, with 75% of his points coming from
                            the midrange</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Finally, I want to share that if you're ever interested a breaking down or checking out stats,
                        you have three main options. Either a) look at the 'Stats' page for individual stats, b) the
                        team's home pages for team stats, and c) the 'results worksheet' for all stats that are tracked.
                        While it can be hard to read, the results worksheet is the best way to compare performances
                        between teams, players, or days. Thanks for reading!</p>
