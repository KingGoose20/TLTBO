                    <p>After two months of hard work, we have reached Finals Week. Over the tournament, every player has
                        played their heart out, doing the most they can to give their team a chance to win the
                        championship. After each day, Loose Gooses guard Clarrie Jones would release rankings for
                        offence and defence, from 1 through to 5. A player was rewarded 5 points from coming first on
                        the list, and 1 point for coming fifth. Each of the players on this list made the Top 5 at
                        least twice in the season, which is an incredible accomplishment seeing the amount of skill in
                        this league. Congratulations to everyone selected on these lists.</p>

                    <h4>Offensive:</h4>
                    <p>PG: Clarrie Jones (12 points)</p>
                    <p>SG: Nicholas Szogi (7 points)</p>
                    <p>SF: Lukas Johnston (5 points)</p>
                    <p>PF: William Kim (14 points)</p>
                    <p>C: Chistopher Tomkinson (5 points)</p>
                    <p id="offensiveDescription">These 5 would make a great team. They have all-round scoring ability,
                        from shot creation, to the ability to hit tough shots in the post, open midranges, and the
                        ability to get past anyone. They would be a tough team to defend, not real weaknesses are
                        evident.</p>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <h4>Defensive:</h4>
                    <p>PG: Mitch Yue (2 points)</p>
                    <p>SG: Clarrie Jones (7 points)</p>
                    <p>SF: Michael Iffland (15 points)</p>
                    <p>PF: Nicholas Szogi (5 points)</p>
                    <p>C: Chistopher Tomkinson (5 points)</p>
                    <p id="defensiveDescription">These 5 would make a solid defensive team. They have size (in height
                        and width ðŸ˜‰), and have the ability to defend the fast, twitchy players, but also defend the
                        post well. They have a great balance in defensive ability, and it would be difficult to
                        highlight a weakness.</p>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <p>As always, the top 5's takes all manners of basketball into account. Any questions or complaints,
                        email me.
