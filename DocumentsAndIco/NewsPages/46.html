                    <br><br><br>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">The Wet Willies were known all season for their skills and dominance.
                        It seems obvious that they
                        would win the tournament, but their victory is nothing short of incredible and serves as an
                        inspiration to all the other teams who aspire for greatness in future terms. <br><br>
                        What really set the Wet Willies apart from other teams is their long-standing dedication to
                        their craft. They have been playing together for weeks, honing their skills and developing a
                        strong offensive skillset on the court. Their persistence and unwavering commitment to their
                        goals (including Clarrie Jones’s dream of hitting multiple threes) have paid off in a big
                        way.<br><br>
                        Throughout the LTB tournament, the Wet Willies showed a remarkable ability to adapt and adjust
                        their strategies as needed. They identified the other teams’ weaknesses quickly and took
                        advantage of them, while also switching up their own game plan if necessary. This flexibility
                        and adaptability allowed them to stay ahead of the competition and ultimately secure the
                        victory.<br><br>
                        To back this up, their exceptional communication on the court was a key component of their
                        victory. They were constantly talking to each other, giving advice, and cheering each other on,
                        especially from their teammate of the year Willie Weekes. This open communication helped them
                        stay organized and focused, and it allowed them to make quick decisions when necessary.<br><br>
                        The Wet Willies' victory in the LTBO tournament was a testament to their hard work, dedication,
                        and teamwork. Congratulations to the Wet Willies, and may they continue to dominate and impress
                        us with their incredible skills and talent in the future.

                    <h3 class="fade-in">The winner is none other than</h3>

                    <h3 class="fade-in" style="font-size: 40px;">CLARRIE JONES!</h3>
                    <br><br>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Dropping 13 points over the day, including a whopping 5 of their teams
                        7 in the Decider Game, Clarrie Jones, guard of the Wet Willies, wins Finals MVP. From the start,
                        quite literally, Clarrie was red-hot from the three point line, with FIVE three pointers over
                        the day. His ability to shoot the ball took a significant amount of pressure off his teammates,
                        and when everyone was focused on him, he consistently made the right pass to find his teammates
                        open. Grabbing himself an assist in the Decider, he was the cause of 6 of his teams 7 points. He
                        consistently locked his opponents down, with his defence looking similar to his idol Jrue
                        Holiday of the Mi(L)waukee Sucks. From going 4th in the draft, with everyone around him doubting
                        him and putting him down, Clarrie worked on his craft all term to prove the haters wrong and to
                        come up big time. Going from averaging just 0.6 ppg in the regular season to 7.3, is quite the
                        improvement, and the improvement that the Wet Willies needed. With multiple game winners,
                        terrific play making, a high-scoring performance, AND excellent defence, there’s no doubt that
                        Clarrie deserved to win the Finals MVP. It was a truly spectacular performance. Congratulations
                        Clarrie Jones. Don’t stop now, keep working your way to MVP. </p>
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <p>And this concludes the first tournament. <br>Rest up over the holidays, because next term we'll have a bigger, better, more exciting tournament, and I know it won't be something to miss.</p>
