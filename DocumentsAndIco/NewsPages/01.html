          <p>With the second term of Lunchtime Basketball just a few days away, I thought it would be best to breakdown
            any changes surrounding the tournament for the term. I will be covering three
            different topics, a) the draft b) the website c) the tournament. Enjoy!
          </p>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading centered">The Draft</h2>
          <p>Just like how last term we had a draft, this term we have another. However, there are a few major changes.
            The first big change is the introduction of retaining players. Each GM now has
            the option to retain a player that they had on their team, with an exception that the 5 Musketeers can
            retain someone from the Wet Willies (a compensation to the fact that Michael Iffland,
            a former 5 Musketeer, is now the Wet Willies GM). Player retainment is still to be announced. The remaining
            9 players will enter the draft, where the league will follow a snake format, each
            team getting a pick. As following the Term 1 Champions, the Wet Willies, demands, they will get the first
            pick in the draft, the 5 Musketeers the second, and the Loose Gooses third. The order
            then reverses for the second round, and starts again for the third round. The announcement of the draft is
            also different this term, as each pick will be announced on the <a href="../Draft.html">Draft page.</a>
            Each pick will be seperated by one minute, meaning the whole event will last ~9 minutes. Player retainment
            will also be announced before the draft starts. The time of the draft is TBD, but you can see the countdown
            on the page.
          </p>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading centered">The Website</h2>
          <p>I'm sure by now you've noticed by now, but there have been a number of changes to the website. The most
            noticeable change is the colour scheme switch, with the website now having more orange, and the
            logo is now blue. These are simply small changes to make things stand out more. However, there has been
            another, much more major change to the website: the <a href="../Stats.html">Stats page</a>. Stats
            is a new, easy way to quickly view and compare individual stats. It tracks a range of categories: points,
            finishes, midranges, and threes, as well as any accolades and the history of the player (e.g. being
            drafted to a team or traded). It also features results from each day. Currently, the stats page has updated
            accolades, but random stats to highlight what it does. The new stats page will make it significantly easier
            to track and see your stats, rather than opening the excel file (however, this is still available in the <a
              href="../Results.html">Results page</a> if you wish for more detailed results)
          </p>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <h2 class="section-heading centered">The Tournament</h2>
          <p>While there aren't a huge heaps of changes to the tournament, I'll go over some of the basic changes.
            Firstly, the structure of the tournament is as so: <span style="color: red">Week 1) Preseason </span> <span
              style="color:mediumblue">Week 2-6) Regular Season </span> <span style="color: gold">Week 7-8) Finals Week
              / Grand Finale </span> <span style="color: green"> Week 9) Postseason</span>.
            Secondly, there have been some slight rule changes, such a prohibiting trade requests, and the rule of '3
            fouls and you're out' has been removed. However, the free throw rule still stands as usual.
          </p>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <p>And those are all the changes to the tournament for this term! If anything doesn't make sense, or you have
            more questions, feel free to contact me. </p>
